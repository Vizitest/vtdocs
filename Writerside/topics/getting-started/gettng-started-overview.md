# Overview & System Requirements
Vizitest runs on a local development machine. It never sends anything into the Cloud.

Below are a few observations that you should be aware of.

- Vizitest is currently available for Java only. In 2024 we will be adding support for C#, C/C++, Typescript and Python.
- It is currently installed as a simple IntelliJ plugin that runs the main Vizitest service. We will soon remove the need a plugin, so it can run independently of an IDE.
- You can connect Vizitest to any codebase on your local machine from the Test Manager.
- Vizitest stores its data in your codebase in a JSON format and is Git compatible.

## System Requirements
Minimum requirements for running Vizitest.

- Java 8 or later.
- IntelliJ Community or Ultimate, Version 2022.3 or later. We will soon be removing all dependencies on the IDE, so you can use any IDE.
- Minimum of 2GB available memory, but more is better!
- Windows, macOS, Linux
- A modern browser. We recommend Chrome.

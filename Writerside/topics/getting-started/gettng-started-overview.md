# Overview
Vizitest runs on a local development machine. It never sends anything into the Cloud.

Below are a few observations that you should be aware of.

- Vizitest is currently available for Java only. In 2024 we will be adding support for C#, C/C++, Typescript and Python.
- It is currently installed as a simple IntelliJ plugin that runs the main Vizitest service. We will soon remove the need a plugin, so it can run independently of an IDE.
- You can connect Vizitest to any codebase on your local machine from the Test Manager.
- Vizitest stores its data in your codebase in a JSON format and is Git compatible.

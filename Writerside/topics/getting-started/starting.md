# Starting Vizitest
Vizitest is started whenever IntelliJ starts. This can take a short while. You will get a notification once successfully started.

You can then start the Vizitest Manager in any of the following ways.

- Click the link in the "Vizitest Started" Notification.
- Select the IntelliJ **Vizitest** or **{}** (OS dependent) menu item
  - Select either **Open In IDE** 
  - or **Open in Browser**.
- It's generally easier to open Test Configurations from the Test Manager, but can also open them directly by double-clicking on a ```.tconfig``` file in the ```.vizitest``` folder in the root of your codebase.

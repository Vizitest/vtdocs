# The Readability problem

## The Problem
Hand coded tests, even written with care and attention, might make sense while they're fresh in one's mind. But look at it in 6 months and it's suddenly mysterious and take an age to decipher. This problem is compounded when read by someone other than the person who write the test.

## The Solution
Vizitest's canvas based approach is highly visual and makes it easy to understand not just for developers but also for QA's and Product Owners.

Rather than reading through tens or hundreds of lines of code, you can see the whole picture, literally, on the canvas.

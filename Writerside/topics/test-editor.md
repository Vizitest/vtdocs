# The Test Editor

The Test Editor is a canvas where your tests are configured.

A very simple Test Configuration might look like this.

Three components are shown.

1. An [Instance Component](instance-component.md) that instantiates a Class.
2. A [Method Component](method-component.md) that tests the boolean method ```testInt()```.
3. A [Test Case Table](test-case-table.md).

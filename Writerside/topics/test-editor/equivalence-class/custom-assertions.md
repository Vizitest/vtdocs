# Creating and coding Custom Assertions

## COMING VERY SOON

Custom Assertions allow you write code to handle your own assertion logic. Rather than the Output assertion being automatically handled by Vizitest, it can be desirable for you to code your own logic to handle the assertion. 

## Creating
You specify the use of a Custom Assertion in the [Method component](method-component.md).

1. In the Custom Assertions section of the Verification column, hover over the title bar and press the **+** icon.
2. Select the dropdown, which will initially contain ```null```.
3. Press the **Add new** button. You will then see the following dialog.

[TODO - screenshot and instructions]


## Coding
Once you have [generated the test code](codegen.md) from the [Test Case Table](test-case-table.md), you will find the Custom Assertion code snippet in the test code itself.

```
private static void assertMyCustomAssertion(AllTogether instance, CreditReturnStatus result, CustomMatcherIsApprovedTestData data) {
    // TODO implement Custom Assertion
    // please implement your own custom assertion here
    // you can find the parameters defined for your custom matcher under data.<name>CustomMatcher
    // assertEquals(data.<name>CustomMatcher, result);
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}
```

You should replace with internal boilerplate code with your own assertion logic. They important thing is that call ```assertEquals()``` (or other assert method) so the test runner can interpret the test outcome.

### Custom Assertion method arguments
The Custom Assertion method will always have at least one argument but may have up to three.

[TODO - Daniel please check below for accuracy]

#### The ```data``` argument
This is always present. It has the rather lengthy and not too nicely named type of ```CustomMatcherCustomAssertionNameTestData``` where **CustomAssertionName** is the name you specified when defining the Custom Assertion in the Method component.

Its properties are the parameter values that you defined when adding the Custom Assertion.

#### The ```result``` argument
This will be present if the method under test has any return type other than ```void```. 

It contains the value that the method under test returned when being invoked with the test case data.

#### The ```instance``` argument
This will be present if the method under test is not static. It contains a reference to the Instance that the method belongs to.

# Setting Equivalence Classes and Representative Values
Please refer to the Equivalence Class [Theory](theory-ecs.md) and [Practice](practice-ecs.md) pages if you are not yet familiar with Equivalence Classes.

You will use Equivalence Classes extensively in the Instance and Method components. This describes how to set them

**Instance Component**
This shows an Instance Component with one Equivalence Class. It contains three Representative Values with a complex type being passed via a constructor.

**Method Component**
This shows a Method Component with valid Equivalence Classes. You will see promitive Representative Values in ```int creditSought``` and complex in **Return Values**.

## Adding an Equivalence Class to an Instance

1. Press the large + icon in the top right of the component.
2. Toggle between a valid and invalid type by clicking the icon
3. Change the name of the Equivalence Class to something logical. Well-chosen names will help when running your tests (and looking at the generated code) as they will appear as labels and comments.

## Adding an Equivalence Class to a Method

1. Press the + icon in one of the section header bar. This will appear when you hover over it.
2. Toggle between a valid and invalid type by clicking the icon
3. Change the name of the Equivalence Class to something logical. Well-chosen names will help when running your tests (and looking at the generated code) as they will appear as labels and comments.
  
## Adding a Representative Value
Hover over an Equivalence Class name and press the **+Add** button.

### Changing a primitive value
This is straightforward. Click on any value as highlighted below.

You can then enter the value directly in the field.

### Changing a complex data type
Complex data types are summarized as json in the value field as shown below. You can see that there are three values already entered.

This is an Instance component and the Class constructor has two parameters. ```String name``` can be edited in place.

However, ```LocalDateTime dateOfBirth``` is a complex data type.

To edit, click in the value field and it will expand. 

<img src="r-value-complex-1.png" alt="" width="400"/>

You can see here that we are able to choose the constructor to use when instantiating the object. You can change the constructor here by clicking an orange constructor pill.

The ```String name``` field can be edited in place but ```LocalDateTime dateOfBirth``` cannot, so we click on this field to edit it.

A new, nested area will appear where you can edit each of the values.

### Collapsing, saving, discarding
Any complex data type values you have edited will leave the expanded section open until you explicitly change it.

You can discard changes by pressing the X button or keep them by pressing the âœ“ button.

## Instantiating with a User Method
By default, Vizitest will use a constructor to instantiate a Representative Value with a complex data type.

If you want to instantiate it with your own (factory) method then select the Representative Value and press the **+ User Method** button.

Any previously defined User Methods are shown in a light blue color.

You will then see the following dialog.

You will notice that the return tpe is automatically set to the data type of the instance's class.

- Enter the name of the new method. Use the normal method naming conventions, so no spaces etc.
- Press the **+** button to add as many parameters as your method requires.
- specify the data type and argument name for each added argument.
- Press **Add** to save and close the dialog.

You will now see your new method added, as a blue pill, and selected. The parameters you defined (```int age``` and ```double amount```) can now be edited.

### User Methods without parameters
There are rare cases when you might want to use a User Method without any parameters. A typical example would be if you are using the **Object Mother Pattern**.

### Implementing your User Method
This User Method generates the method boilerplate for you when the test code is generated. You can then write the necessary code in that method to handle the instantiation.

If you open the generated test (generated from the [Test Case Table](test-case-table.md)) then you will see the boilerplate ready for you to edit.

```java
//region Factories
	private static CreditCheck MyFactoryMethod(Integer age, Double amount) {
		// TODO implement factory
		throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
	}
//endregion
```

You can now replace the lines

```
  // TODO implement factory
  throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
```

...with your own implementation. Note that the return type is automatically provided in the method signature.

# Running your tests
Vizitest generates tests that look and operate in the exact same way as a hand-coded test.

This means you can run a test from your IDE, the command line, a CI/CD pipeline etc.

## Parameterized Tests
Vizitest test code makes heavy use of parameterization. Each test case will have a set of parameters that it can then pass to a shared function for handling the [TODO - Daniel??].

[TODO - example code]

This makes your code clean, compact AND readable.

## What can I customize?
Typically, a Vizitest generated test does not need any EXTRA handwritten coding. However, there are some cases where this is either desirable or required.

## Required Coding
If you have used any of the following in your Test Configuration then you will need to add custom code to the generated code file.

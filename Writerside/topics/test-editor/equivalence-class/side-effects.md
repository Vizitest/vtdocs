# Side Effects
You configure **Side Effects** in the right hand column of the Method component.

[TODO : screenshot]

## When to use it?
You would use a Side Effects if the Method Under test

-  does not return a value that you can, or want to, test against
-  and does mutate the object such that you can inspect that mutation to assert whether the test case has passed or failed.

## How to add
1. In the Verification -> Side Effects section of the Method component, hover over the title bar and select **+ Side effect**.
1. You can now add your Equivalence Class and Representative values in the normal way.

[TODO : this explanation is wrong.not deep enough. needs a full example]

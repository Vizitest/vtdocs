# Deleting Groups

You can delete a Group by pressing the trash icon in the Group header bar.

<img src="group-delete.png" width="400" alt="delete group"/>

This will delete the Group but leave any children intact and orphaned. You can then reassign the orphaned children [as explained here](group-add-organize.md#connecting-groups).

This operation cannot be undone.

# Test Manager Canvas
The Canvas is a visual representation of your Test Configurations, organized into Groups.

When you create a new Project, one Group will be created for you automatically. We recommend that as the number of Test Configurations grows, you [add more Groups](group-add-organize.md) and create a hierarchy.

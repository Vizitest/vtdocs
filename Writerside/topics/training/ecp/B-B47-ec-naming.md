# Equivalence Class naming
**Unit : B-B47**

This unit is an informational unit.

If you have not done so, please refer to [Valid and Invalid Equivalence Classes](B-B45-valid-invalid.md) for more information on their meaning.

When you add a new Equivalence Class, Vizitest will prompt you to choose a validity status with default Equivalence Class names of **Valid values** and **Invalid values** respectively.

## Renaming
To make their meaning clearer, you can rename the default Equivalence Class names once added to the component by clicking in the Equivalence Class name.

## Where do Equivalence Class names appear?
Equivalence names are not only used in canvas components but also in your test code and test runner output.

So, choosing your Equivalence Class names with thought will help users understand and diagnose better well into the future.

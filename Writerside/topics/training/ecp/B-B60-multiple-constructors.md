# Selecting from multiple constructors
**Repo folder** : [src/main/java/B_B60_MultipleConstructors](github-repo.md)

## Prep
- Find and open the training code.
- In the Test Manager, create a new Test Configuration **Multiple Constructors**.
- Open the new Test Configuration.

## Introduction
This unit shows how to specify a different constructor when instantiating a class. It applies to any complex object in the Representative Value editor. 

## Task

1. Add the Class InstanceBuilder as an Instance Component.
2. Add a Representative Value to an Input Equivalence Class.
3. You'll see that the class's three constructors are all represented as pills. The default constructor is automatically selected.

4. Now select the second constructor and see how the value editor changes accordingly.

That's all there is to working with multiple constructors.

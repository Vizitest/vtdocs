# About Equivalence Classes

It is important to understand what **Equivalence Classes** and **Representative Values** are before moving forward.

They sound rather academic, but they are accepted phrases in formal testing parlance. So, we'll stick with them.

It is a good idea to read about **Equivalence Classes** and **Representative Values** in the [Theory](theory-ecs.md) and [Practice pages](practice-ecs.md) of the User Guide. Don't worry if you don't fully understand everything. It should all become clear as you work through the remaining training units.

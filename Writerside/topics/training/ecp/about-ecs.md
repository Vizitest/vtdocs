# About Equivalence Classes

**Equivalence Classes** and **Representative Values** are important concepts in Viztest.

They sound rather academic, but they are accepted phrases in formal testing parlance. So, we'll stick with them.

If you want some background on them before you move on with further units, try these.

- **Equivalence Classes** and **Representative Values** : [Theory](theory-ecs.md) and [Practice](practice-ecs.md). of the User Guide. 
- [Setting Equivalence Classes and Representative Values](ec-r-value-settings.md).
 
Don't worry if you don't fully understand everything. It should all become clear as you work through the remaining training units. 

Let's go ahead create our [first Test Configuration](simple-static-method.md).

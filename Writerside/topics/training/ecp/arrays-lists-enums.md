# Arrays, Lists and Enums
**Repo folder** : [src/main/java/B_B70_ArrayListEnum](github-repo.md)

## Introduction
Arrays, Lists and Enums behave slightly differently in the [Representative Value editor](ec-r-value-settings.md#arrays-lists-and-enums).

## Prep
- Find and open the training code.
- Take a look at the code to examine its behavior.
- In the Test Manager, [create a new Test Configuration](test-config-add.md) called **Array, List, Enum**. 
- Open the new Test Configuration.

## Task
The ```setValues()``` method just takes three parameters - an Array, a List and a String (this will be replaced with an Enum parameter shortly).

<span style="color:white">TODO</span>
</p>
<p>We are currently fixing a bug with the Test Cases for arrays and lists. The Test Case does not show the Representative Values. Expect a fix shortly.</p>
</warning>

1. Create a Method component to test the ```setListTypeValues()``` method. See the screenshot above and configure similarly.
2. Be sure to set the Exception Output.
3. Generate the Test Cases automatically and set the expected Outputs. Note : this will add six Cases, so scroll the Test Cases by click and dragging to the right. 
4. Generate the test code and run the test.

# Equality Check
As a matter of good practice, you should implement the equality check for data type objects where object comparison is necessary.

- In Java this is the ```equals()``` method.
- In C# it's the ```Equals()``` method.

With testing in general, many tests will want to assert whether ObjectA == ObjectB using the  ```equals``` assertion.

If the equality check does not exist, you will get an error like this (depending on IDE and language).

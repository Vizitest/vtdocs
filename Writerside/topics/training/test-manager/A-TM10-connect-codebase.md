# Connecting to the codebase

The first thing to do is to add a Project and connect it to the training codebase.

In the Vizitest Test Manager (shown when you launch Vizitest), locate the **Projects** list in the top of the left sidebar.

- Add a Project [as explained here](connect-codebase.md). Point the **Path** field to the root folder of the GitHub repository (explained here).
- Set the Project name to **Training** or similar.

You should now have a new Project in the list and a single Group created on the canvas.

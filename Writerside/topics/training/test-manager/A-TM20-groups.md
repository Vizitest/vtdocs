# Creating, labelling and deleting Groups
In this unit, we encourage you to add and organize some Groups.

## Add a Group
Add one or more Groups to the Canvas, as [explained here](group-add-organize.md).

1. Add a Group by hovering on a Group and pressing the + Add a subgroup button that appears on hover.
2. Add a Group by pressing the large blue button in the top left of the canvas.

## Connect an orphaned Group
Play around [connecting](group-add-organize.md#connecting-groups) some of your newly added Groups in parent/child relationship.

## Labelling
Change one of the Group titles to match by clicking in the title of a Group and entering a new title.

You can also set a description by clicking in the area immediately below the title.

## Deleting Connectors
Try removing connecting lines by hovering on the connector line and pressing the X icon.

## Delete Groups
Remove a parent Group first by hovering on the Group and pressing the trash icon. It won't delete child Groups.

To tidy you canvas up a bit, you can remove all the Groups you just added.

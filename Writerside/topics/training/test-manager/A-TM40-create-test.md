# Create a Test Configuration
A Test Configuration is where your actual unit and integration tests are found. A Test Configuration lives within a Group on the Test Manager canvas.

- Choose or create a Group.
- Create a Test Configuration called **Water State** in the **Unit Tests** Group as [explained here](test-config-add.md).

You should now see your new Test Configuration in the Group.

That's it for Test Manager training units. We're now ready to work with a Test Configuration. [Click here](about-ecs.md) to get started.
